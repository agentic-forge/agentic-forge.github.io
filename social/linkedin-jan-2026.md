## Post 1: What's New in Agentic Forge

**Publish first** - pairs with: https://agentic-forge.github.io/blog/whats-new-jan-2026

```
Three updates to Agentic Forge that make building AI agents more flexible:

1️⃣ TOON optimization now works everywhere
Previously our token-saving format only worked with pre-configured tools. Now it automatically optimizes ANY MCP server you connect—including your own custom servers. 30-60% fewer tokens on tool results, no changes needed.

2️⃣ Add your own MCP servers on the fly
Connect any MCP server directly from the UI. No server config required. Test your tools during development, connect to internal servers, or try third-party MCP servers before committing to them.

3️⃣ Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)
Use your own API keys for OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google. Your keys stay in your browser—we never see or store them. You pay your provider directly, use your own quotas, and can switch providers freely.

These changes set the stage for our public demo (announcement coming soon).
